# POPR => Proof of Proofreading

**Goal:** Avoid fake news

A social contract / protocol where to attest you share an information (e.g a custom badge on the post) you need to stake an amount of tokens corresponding to the amount of people you are sharing the information to.

If someone suspects an information to be a fake news it can ask to a dispute protocol (e.g Kleros) and if considered fake the post will be deleted and the account who posted it / shared will be slashed.

Can also be linked to a reputation system powere by a soulbound token

Implementation: This can be implemented as a Lens module
